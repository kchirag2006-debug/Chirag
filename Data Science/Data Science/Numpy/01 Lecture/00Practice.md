# üìù Practice Set ‚Äì NumPy Basics  

## Task 1: Create Arrays  
- Create a 1D array with numbers from 1 to 10.  
- Create a 2D array of size **3x3** filled with ones.  
- Create a 3D array of shape **2x2x3** with random integers between 1 and 20.  

---

## Task 2: Array Attributes  
Given:  
```python
arr = np.array([[5,10,15],[20,25,30],[35,40,45]])
```
- Find its **dimension**, **shape**, **size**, and **data type**.  

---

## Task 3: Special Arrays  
- Create an array of numbers from 50 to 100 with step 10.  
- Create 8 equally spaced values between 0 and 2.  
- Create a **5x5 identity matrix**.  

---

## Task 4: Basic Operations  
Given:  
```python
a = np.array([3,6,9,12])
b = np.array([1,2,3,4])
```
- Perform:  
  - Addition  
  - Subtraction  
  - Multiplication  
  - Division  
  - Square of each element  

---

## Task 5: Indexing (1D)  
Given:  
```python
arr = np.array([5,10,15,20,25,30,35])
```
- Extract the first 4 elements.  
- Extract the last 2 elements.  
- Extract every second element.  
- Change the element at index 3 to **100**.  

---

## Task 6: Indexing (2D)  
Given:  
```python
arr2d = np.array([[11,12,13],[21,22,23],[31,32,33]])
```
- Access element at **row 1, column 2**.  
- Get the **second row**.  
- Get the **first column**.  

---

## Task 7: Useful Functions  
Given:  
```python
arr = np.array([4,8,12,16,20,24])
```
- Find the **minimum, maximum, sum, mean, and standard deviation**.  

---

## Task 8: Reshape Array  
- Create an array with numbers from 1 to 12.  
- Reshape it into a **3x4 matrix**.  
- Reshape it again into a **2x2x3 array**.  

---

## Task 9: Compare List vs NumPy Speed üöÄ  
- Create a Python list and a NumPy array with **1 million numbers**.  
- Add 5 to each element using both methods.  
- Compare the execution time.  

---

## Task 10: Bonus Challenge  
- Generate a **4x4 random matrix** with integers between 1 and 50.  
- Find:  
  - Maximum element of each row  
  - Minimum element of each column  
  - The sum of all elements
